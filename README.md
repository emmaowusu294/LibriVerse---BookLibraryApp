## Description

LibriVerse is a web application built with ASP.NET Core MVC that functions as an online digital library. It allows a single administrator to manage a curated collection of digital books and grant timed access (digital loans) to registered users ( as Patrons). Patrons can browse the catalog, borrow books, and access their loaned content directly through the site.

This project was developed primarily as a learning exercise for ASP.NET Core concepts.
